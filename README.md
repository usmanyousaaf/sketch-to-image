# Sketch-to-Image Conversion using GAN

## Overview

This project leverages Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to convert hand-drawn sketches into realistic images. By training a GAN on a dataset of paired sketches and images, the model learns to generate detailed and accurate images from simple line drawings.

## Features

- **Sketch-to-Image Conversion**: Converts hand-drawn sketches into photorealistic images.
- **Deep Learning**: Utilizes GANs to perform the conversion, ensuring high-quality results.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to different types of sketches and image styles.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for users to upload sketches and get generated images.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset of paired sketches and corresponding images.
2. **Preprocessing**: Prepare the dataset by normalizing images and converting sketches to a suitable format.
3. **Training the GAN**: Train the GAN model on the dataset, optimizing it to generate realistic images from sketches.
4. **Image Generation**: Use the trained model to convert new sketches into images.
